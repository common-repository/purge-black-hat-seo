This plugin will scan through all your posts and pages purging any malicious black-hat SEO infection

== Description ==
There has been an increase in attacks on wp sites where attackers implant malicous contents into your posts and pages that are not visible to human users but visible to crawlers such as google. Therefore we made this plugin, which will scan through all your posts and pages purging any malicious black-hat SEO infection.

However, you would still need to find and remove the virus that generates this malicious infection.

How to use:

* Please make sure to make a full backup of your DB (or at leat your pages and posts) in case you want to revert back.
* Find the signature of the infection. usually it got "style:" with weird padding, alignment numbers etc (to hide from human user). See screenshots for an example.
* There are few control checkboxs to target certain pages or posts.
